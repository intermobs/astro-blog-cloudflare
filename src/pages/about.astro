    <p>
      Our church is a Christ–centered, Spirit–led ministry based in Nhlangano, Eswatini. 
      We are a family of believers committed to worship, prayer, discipleship, and sharing 
      the message of Jesus Christ with our community and beyond.
    </p>

    <p>
      The ministry was founded under the leadership of <strong><a href="https://jeffsum.com/" target="_blank">Apostle D. Dlamini</a></strong>, 
      who carries a deep passion for seeing lives transformed by the power of God. 
      Through teaching, prophecy, deliverance, and pastoral care, Apostle Den continues to 
      guide the church with wisdom, humility, and a heart for God’s people.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our vision is to raise believers who know God personally, walk in His purpose, 
      and live out their faith daily. We believe in the full gospel of Jesus Christ — 
      salvation, healing, restoration, and spiritual growth through the Word of God 
      and the work of the Holy Spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      We welcome people of all ages and backgrounds to fellowship with us. 
      Whether you are seeking a church home, spiritual guidance, or a place to 
      encounter the presence of God, you are invited to join us in worship and fellowship.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our services include Sunday worship, weekly prayer and teaching gatherings, 
      youth and family ministry, and community outreach programs aimed at 
      supporting and uplifting our local community in Nhlangano and surrounding areas.
    </p>

    <p>
      We believe the church is more than a building — it is a living family of faith, 
      hope, and love. We look forward to welcoming you and walking with you on 
      your spiritual journey.
