      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>Grace Community Church was founded in 1995 by a small group of families with a shared vision: to create a welcoming place where people from all walks of life could encounter God's grace, grow in faith, and build lasting relationships. Over the years, we've grown into a vibrant congregation while staying true to our roots in Bible-centered teaching and community outreach.</p>

      <h2>Our Beliefs</h2>
      <p>We are a Bible-believing church that affirms the core truths of Christianity:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Bible is the inspired and authoritative Word of God.</li>
        <li>There is one God, eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</li>
        <li>Jesus Christ is the Son of God, born of a virgin, who lived a sinless life, died for our sins, and rose again.</li>
        <li>Salvation is by grace through faith in Jesus Christ alone.</li>
        <li>We are called to love God with all our heart and to love our neighbors as ourselves.</li>
      </ul>
